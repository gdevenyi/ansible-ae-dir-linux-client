This directory contains an ansible role for configuring Linux clients for Ã†-DIR.
sssd or nss-pam-ldapd can be used.

Note that this role is deprecated and thus it is not maintained anymore.
It is kept in this repo only for documentation purposes.

You should use [aehostd](https://www.ae-dir.com/aehostd.html) instead.
